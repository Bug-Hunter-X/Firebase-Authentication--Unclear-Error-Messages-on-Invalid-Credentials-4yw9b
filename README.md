This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, issue with Firebase Authentication: unhelpful error messages when users enter incorrect email/password combinations.  The provided `authBug.js` file showcases the problem, where a generic error is returned instead of a clear indication of invalid credentials.  The solution (`authSolution.js`) provides a more robust approach to handling authentication errors by checking for specific error codes and providing user-friendly feedback.
