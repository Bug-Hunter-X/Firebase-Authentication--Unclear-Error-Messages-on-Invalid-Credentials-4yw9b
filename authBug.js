The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the user's email/password combination is incorrect.  The error message may not be informative, making debugging difficult. For example, the error might be a generic network error, even though the real issue is authentication failure. This makes it hard to differentiate between genuine network problems and incorrect credentials.
